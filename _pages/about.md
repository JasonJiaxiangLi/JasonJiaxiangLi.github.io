Hi, welcome to my page! I am a postdoctoral associate at the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://cse.umn.edu/ece), [University of Minnesota](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/), supervised by [Prof. Mingyi Hong](https://people.ece.umn.edu/~mhong/mingyi.html), also working with [Prof. Shuzhong Zhang](https://sites.google.com/umn.edu/shuzhong-zhang). I obtained my Ph.D. degree at the [Department of Mathematics](https://math.ucdavis.edu/), [UC Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/), advised by [Prof. Krishna Balasubramanian](https://sites.google.com/view/kriznakumar/) and [Prof. Shiqian Ma](https://sqma.rice.edu/). Prior to this, I received my B.S. degree in Mathematics from [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/english/). 

My research interests are optimization problems arising in machine learning, operations research and other applications. I am working on the following topics:
- **Nonconvex Optimization**: Computational complexities for gradient-based and gradient-free (zeroth-order) algorithms, optimization on Riemannian manifolds and primal-dual optimization algorithms.
- **Variational Inequalities**: Convergence theory for variational inequality with applications in minimax problems.
- **Distributed Optimization**: Convergence theory for distributed optimization algorithms, including decentralized and federated learning.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Theories for reinforcement learning algorithms, especially for multi-armed bandits and convergence of policy-based methods.

I am also interested in theory and computation for supervised and unsupervised learning in general.
