I am a 5th-year Ph.D. student at the [Department of Mathematics](https://math.ucdavis.edu/), [UC Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/), advised by [Prof. Shiqian Ma](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~sqma/), also working with [Prof. Krishna Balasubramanian](https://sites.google.com/view/kriznakumar/). Prior to this, I received my B.S. degree in Mathematics from [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) (thesis advisor: [Prof. Xianliang Hu](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/xlhu)). My research interests are the optimization problems arising in machine learning, operations research and other applications. I am working on the following topics:

- **Nonconvex Optimization**: Computational complexities for gradient-based and gradient-free algorithms, opti- mization on Riemannian manifolds and primal-dual optimization algorithms.
- **Variational Inequalities**: Convergence theory for variational inequality with applications in minimax problems.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Theories for reinforcement learning algorithms, especially for multi-armed bandits and convergence of policy-based methods.

I am also interested in theory and computation for supervised and unsupervised learning in general.
