## Research Directions

My research interests are optimization problems arising in machine learning, operations research and other applications. I am working on the following topics:
- Computational complexities for gradient-based and gradient-free (zeroth-order) algorithms for solving nonconvex optimizations, optimization on Riemannian manifolds and primal-dual optimization algorithms.
- Convergence theory for deterministic and stochastic minimax/bilevel problems with applications in operations research and machine learning.
- Distributed optimization algorithms, including decentralized and federated learning.
- Theories for reinforcement learning algorithms, especially for multi-armed bandits and convergence of policy-based methods, and their applications in large language model (LLM) alignments.

I am also interested in theory and computation for supervised and unsupervised learning in general.
